<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey!
  This is Keerthi Deshpande and im currently pursuing my Bachelors in Information Sceince Engineering. Im fond of art
  and creativity which is why i chose web development as my domain. It helps me to deep dive my creative side and make
  sure I utilize it wisely.
</p>

<p>These are my first two websites that i have created on my own , i know they are quite simple , the reason being 
  that im still a beginner and these websites are based on HTML only. Its not that im proud of them , offcourse i am.
  Im looking forward to more stylized and artistic websites in future. But right now the portfolio is a simple version
  containing my first two websites.
